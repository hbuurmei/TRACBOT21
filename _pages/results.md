After a few weeks of hard work, the robot is fully integrated and operational.

### Robot Assembly
We show our fully assembled robot in the images below.
The robot is built with a combination of 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components.

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>


### Competition Day
We succesfully competed with other teams on competition day.
Although we did not make it to the finals, we are proud of our performance and the robot we built.
Below is a picture of the setup, with our robot on the left starting zone, about to start the first round of the competition.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/competition_day.jpeg" title="Competition day" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
