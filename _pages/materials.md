For this project, we mostly relied on off-the-shelf components and materials, especially those that were readily available in the ME210 Lab and the Stanford Product Realization Lab.
This allowed us to quickly iterate on our design and make changes as necessary.
More details on the materials used can be found below.

### Bill of Material (BOM)

The bill of material (BOM)<d-footnote>Note that only components that had to be bought are included, not the 3D printed parts.</d-footnote> is a list of all the parts and materials that are required to build the robot and is provided below.

The total cost is **$142.37**, which is well below the allocated $200 budget.
